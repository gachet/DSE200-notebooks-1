    "The folder economics (~/DSE200/DSE200/data/economics/) has a set of small datasets corresponding to different economics topics. We will use Pandas to incorporate these datasets into our workflow, merge them and analyze the economic trends as a function of time.\n",
    "\n",
    "To achieve this, do the following\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Read each of the csv files iteratively\n",
    "2. Merge all of the data into a single dataframe.\n",
    "3. Construct the Term and Default premia series using basic math on the series, and mmerge the resulting series using JOIN operation. HINT: term_premium = merged_data[’GS10’] - merged_data[’GS1’] and default_premium = merged_data[’BAA’] - merged_data[’AAA’]\n",
    "4. Process the data. Processing the data is of utmost importance for better readability and understanding of the data. Process the above data by ensuring the following:\n",
    "    i. dropping the rows with null values\n",
    "    ii. Output data regularly to see if they are following regular format. Use pandas.series.pct_change/pandas.DataFrame.cumsum wherever necessary\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Plot ’GDP_growth’,’IP_growth’ and 'Unemp_rate' a a function of time and draw inferences\n",
    "6. Use pandas function scatter_matrix to generate scatter plots of ’GDP_growth’,’IP_growth’ and 'Unemp_rate' in a mmatrix form with kernel density plots along the diagonals.\n",
