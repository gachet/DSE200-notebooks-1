    "Adapted from a page created by [John Beieler](https://gist.github.com/johnb30/4743272)\n",
    "\n",
    "> Even with the best of websites, I don’t think I’ve ever encountered a scraping job that couldn’t be described as *“A small and simple general model with heaps upon  piles of annoying little exceptions”* \n",
    "\n",
    ">> \\- Swizec Teller [http://swizec.com/blog/scraping-with-mechanize-and-beautifulsoup/swizec/5039](http://swizec.com/blog/scraping-with-mechanize-and-beautifulsoup/swizec/5039)\n",
    "\n",
    "## What is it?\n",
    "\n",
    "A large portion of the data that we as social scientists are interested in resides on the web in manner. Web scraping is a method for pulling data from the structured (or not so structured!) HTML that makes up a web page. Python has numerous libraries for approaching this type of problem, many of which are incredibly powerful. If there is something you want to do, there's usually a way to accomplish it. Perhaps not easily, but it can be done. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## How is it accomplished?\n",
    "\n",
    "In general, there are three problems that you might face when undertaking a scraping task:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. You have a single page, or a set of pages, that you know of and you want to scrape.\n",
    "2. You have a source that generates links, e.g., [RSS feeds](http://rss.nytimes.com/services/xml/rss/nyt/World.xml), to various pages with the same structure.\n",
    "3. You have a page that contains many pages of interest that are scattered across the file system and you only have general rules for reaching these pages. \n",
    "\n",
    "The key is that you must identify which type of problem you have. After this, you must look at the HTML structure of a webpage and construct a script that will select the parts of the page that are of interest to you.\n",
    "\n",
    "## There's a library for that! \n",
    "\n",
    "As mentioned previously, Python has various libraries for scraping tasks. The ones I have found the most useful are:\n",
    "\n",
    "- [lxml](http://lxml.de/)\n",
    "- [requests](http://docs.python-requests.org/en/latest/)\n",
    "- [Scrapy](http://doc.scrapy.org/en/0.16/)\n",

    "let's inspect a [mongabay web page](http://names.mongabay.com/data/1000.html). Open the page in a separate tab, it should look something like the image below. Mongapay is a site that has a nice collection of statistics about first and last names.\n",

    "The source code language for web pages is HTML (Hyper-Text Markup-Language]. HTML is a hierarchical description of the visual content of a page. You can view the source, in Chrome, by choosing `View/Developer/View Source`. However, commercial web pages are very complex and inspecting them requires a more powerful method.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Chrome browsr comes with such a tool built in. You can open this tool by choosing `View/Developer/Developer Tools`\n",
    "\n",
    "If you are using Firefox you can install the [Firebug](https://getfirebug.com/) plugin which gives similar functionality.\n",
    "\n",
    "The bottom half of the browser page will now have a sophisticated development environment for all things web (HTML, CSS, Javascript).\n",
    "In particular it allows you to click on a visual element in the page and find out where it is in the source and what tags it is associated with\n",

You can also write a **Spider** or **Crawler** i.e. a program that will follow links to extract and process all of the pages of a particular type from a web site. Later in this notebook there is an example of using Scrapy for crawling. \n",

You could visit the homepage of the NYT and work from there, or you can use an [RSS feed](http://rss.nytimes.com/services/xml/rss/nyt/World.xml). RSS stands for Real Simple Syndication and is, at its heart, an XML document. This allows it to be easily parsed. The fantastic library `pattern` allows for easy parsing of RSS feeds. Using `pattern`'s `Newsfeed()` method, it is possible to parse a feed and obtain attributes of the XML document. The `search()` method returns an iterable composed of the individual stories. Each result has a variety of attributes such as `.url`, `.title`, `.description`, and more. The following code demonstrates these methods."

    "Getting back on topic, it is often more difficult than the above to iterate over numerous webpages within a site. This is where the `Scrapy` library comes in. `Scrapy` allows for the creation of web spiders that crawl over a webpage, following any links that it finds. This is often far more difficult to implement than a simple scraper since it requires the identification of rules for link following. The [State Department](http://www.state.gov/r/pa/prs/dpb/2012/index.htm) offers a good example. I don't really have time to go into the depths of writing a `Scrapy` spider, but I thought I would put up some code to illustrate what it looks like."

    "Web scraping is much, much, *much*, more of an art than a science. It is often non-trivial to identify the XPath selector that will get you what you want. Also, some web programmers can't seem to decide how they want to structure the pages they write, so they just change the HTML every few pages. Notice that for the NYT example if `articleBody` gets changed to `articleBody1`, everything breaks. There are ways around this that are often convoluted, messy, and hackish. Usually, however, where there is a will there is a way.\n",
